# Oxidation
A little IN/OUT thing written in Rust.

## Project Aims

To increase my understanding of Rust by building something useful.

The end result should be a server that accepts "Event" type messages and holds them to be processed / consumed.

Inspiration is being drawn from [Azure EventHubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html), [Lapin](https://github.com/CleverCloud/lapin) and the [AMPQ Spec](https://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/specs/amqp0-9-1.pdf).
